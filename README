What is this?

This is a small web-based (rails) project for tracking high scores in games. It is primarily used to make my life easier when updating high score threads on the shmups.com forums. The basic gist is that I can add games to this database, define certain column orders and then import the scores people post. I can then filter the entries based on certain columns and generate high score tables for pasting into the forum posts. Formatting is done via the mustache plugin. 

TODO:

 * make the entry input a bit more tolerant of mis-formatting.
 * un-uglify the score display interface
 * fixed-width columns in formatted output?
 * Ability to split tables by a field all on one page, and generate a huge bbcode/formatted string for all tables.
